The C file cp2112_demo.c has been modified from Nickdademo's original. 
It no longer tries to communicate with the battery charger, only the battery.
You can see the original code that has been commented out.
Reading the Temperature has been added.
If charging, is gives the time to full, else it gives the time to empty.
